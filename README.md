# sales-data-analysis-and-visualization
A Python-based sales data analysis project focusing on data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. The project identifies best-selling products, top international markets, revenue trends, and customer segmentation using Pandas and Matplotlib.

This project focuses on analyzing a large-scale retail sales dataset using Python. The dataset contains over 500,000 transaction records, making it suitable for big data-style analysis using efficient data processing techniques.

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, where missing customer records are removed, invalid quantities are filtered out, and date fields are converted into proper datetime formats. Additional features such as total transaction value are engineered to support revenue-based analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to extract meaningful business insights. This includes identifying the top and least selling products in the United Kingdom based on quantity sold, analyzing international market performance by total revenue, and comparing regional sales across countries. Monthly revenue trends for top international markets are also examined to understand seasonal and market-based patterns.

Several visualizations are created using Matplotlib to clearly represent insights, including bar charts for product and country-level sales, line charts for revenue trends, and pie charts for customer segmentation. Customers are segmented into high, medium, and low-value groups based on total spending, providing insights into customer behavior and value distribution.
